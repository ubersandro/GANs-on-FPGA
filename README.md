# GANs-on-FPGA
This repository hosts the code related to the project "Generative adversarial networks on FPGA" realized in collaboration with NECSTLab (Politecnico di Milano).
The project targets a ULTRA96v2 board by AVNET. The OS image used to run the deep learning model inference is PYNQ DPU 3.0 for ULTRA96v2 and the .xmodel has been produced using Xilinx Vitis AI 2.5.
